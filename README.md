# Design and Implementation of a Knowledge-Aware AI Assistant

## Problem Statement
Modern AI chatbots often generate responses without verifying facts or referencing a reliable knowledge base. 
This leads to hallucinations, outdated answers, and lack of transparency.

## Proposed Solution
This project aims to design and implement a **Knowledge-Aware AI Assistant** that retrieves relevant information 
from a structured knowledge base before generating responses, ensuring accuracy, contextual relevance, and source attribution.

## Key Features
- Document ingestion (PDFs, text files)
- Semantic search using vector embeddings
- Context-aware response generation using LLMs
- Source citation for transparency
- Interactive user interface

## Technologies Planned
- Python
- Vector Databases (FAISS / ChromaDB)
- NLP & Embeddings
- Large Language Models
- Streamlit / Flask
- Git & GitHub for version control
