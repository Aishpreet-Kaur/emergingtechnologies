## Problem Statement

AI assistants often respond based purely on probabilistic language modeling rather than verified knowledge.
This results in hallucinated answers and poor reliability in academic or professional contexts.

There is a need for AI systems that can:
- Understand user queries
- Retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base
- Generate responses grounded in factual data
- Provide transparency by citing sources
