## Literature Review

### Semantic Information Retrieval
Semantic information retrieval systems go beyond keyword matching by capturing the contextual meaning
of user queries and documents. Such systems improve the relevance and accuracy of retrieved results.

### Vector Embeddings
Vector embeddings represent textual data as dense numerical vectors that encode semantic relationships.
These embeddings enable efficient similarity search, allowing relevant documents to be retrieved even
when exact keyword matches are absent.

### Knowledge-Aware AI Systems
Knowledge-aware AI systems rely on external knowledge sources rather than generating content solely
from learned language patterns. This approach improves reliability, transparency, and factual grounding.

### Limitations of Traditional Chatbots
- Lack of explainability
- No source attribution
- Risk of hallucinated or unverifiable responses
- Static knowledge handling

### Motivation
This project focuses on building a knowledge-aware AI assistant that retrieves and presents factual
information from a curated knowledge base using semantic similarity techniques. The system emphasizes
accuracy, transparency, and explainability, making it suitable for academic and professional use.
